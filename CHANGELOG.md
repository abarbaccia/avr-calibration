# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.5.0] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- `deploy/install.sh` — upgraded minidsp-rs from v0.1.5 to v0.1.12 with corrected asset filename (`minidsp.arm-linux-gnueabihf-rpi.tar.gz`); added `-f` flag to `curl` so HTTP errors fail fast with a clear message instead of silently downloading a 404 HTML page
- `deploy/install.sh` — removed erroneous `--device=/dev/snd` passthrough from Docker run command; UMIK-1 is on the laptop, not the Pi

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` — architecture diagram updated to reflect browser-based audio capture (UMIK-1 on laptop → Web Audio API → Pi server); was incorrectly showing PyTTa running on the Pi
- `docs/deployment/pi-zero-w.md` — hardware diagram corrected: UMIK-1 now shown on the laptop, not the Pi USB hub; `calibrate check` expected output updated to remove UMIK mic check (mic is client-side)

## [0.1.4.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- `Dockerfile` — multi-stage build (builder + runtime); ARMv6 (Pi Zero W) path compiles numpy 1.24.x from source and skips pytta (no LLVM); all other arches build full deps including pytta via `uv sync`
- `.github/workflows/docker.yml` — GitHub Actions CI: cross-compiles `linux/arm/v6` and `linux/amd64` images via QEMU + Buildx, pushes to GHCR on every main push and version tag
- `[measurement]` optional extra in `pyproject.toml` — isolates pytta (and its numba/llvmlite/LLVM chain) so it can be skipped on ARMv6

### Changed
- `deploy/install.sh` — rewritten: Pi now just installs Docker, pulls the pre-built GHCR image, and runs it as a systemd service; no more source builds on the Pi
- `deploy/avr-calibration.service` — updated to run `docker run` with USB device passthrough and `/data/.avr-calibration` volume mount
- `pyproject.toml` — relaxed numpy to `>=1.24.4` (was `>=1.26`; ARMv6 cannot build wheels for 1.26+)
- `Dockerfile` runtime stage sets `ENV HOME=/data` so `config.py` finds `~/.avr-calibration` at the mounted volume path

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- `calibrate web` CLI command — starts a FastAPI web server (`--host`, `--port` options)
- `calibrate/web.py` — FastAPI app with placeholder index page and `/health` endpoint; full web UI ships in next release
- `deploy/install.sh` — Pi Zero W bootstrap script: system packages, uv, numpy ARMv6 pin, minidsp-rs ARM binary, udev rule, config template, systemd service
- `deploy/avr-calibration.service` — systemd unit file for the web server (auto-start on boot)
- `docs/deployment/pi-zero-w.md` — step-by-step Pi Zero W deployment guide
- `fastapi>=0.110` and `uvicorn>=0.29` added as core dependencies
- 7 new tests covering web app endpoints and CLI command at 100% coverage

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- `calibrate history` CLI command — lists all past measurement sessions (id, timestamp, label, peak SPL, point count; checkmark for sessions with a final post-EQ measurement)
- `calibrate show <id>` CLI command — human-readable session detail with ASCII frequency response plot, plus `--csv` and `--json` export modes
- `_ascii_plot()` helper — 10-bar log-spaced ASCII bar chart of frequency response
- `show` command displays feedback notes (text + optional `content_tag`) when present
- `show` command shows final peak SPL and delta (Δ dB) when `end_fr` is recorded
- 15 new tests covering all `history`, `show`, and `_ascii_plot` code paths at 100% coverage
- `update_end_fr()` on `SessionStore` — records post-EQ measurement for a session

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- `calibrate measure` CLI command — runs a log-sweep measurement and saves to SQLite history
- `MeasurementEngine` — PyTTa-based acoustic measurement with lazy import (no PortAudio required at import time)
- `FrequencyResponse` dataclass — serializable result with `to_json`/`from_json`, `peak_spl`, `freq_at_peak`
- Deconvolution via numpy FFT: `H(f) = FFT(recording) / FFT(sweep)`, zero-division guarded, trimmed to calibration band
- `SessionStore` — SQLite session persistence (`~/.avr-calibration/history.db`) with schema designed for `calibrate history` (TODO-2) and content-tagged feedback (TODO-3)
- `add_feedback()` / `get_feedback()` on `SessionStore` — optional `content_tag` field baked in from day one
- `measurement` config section with defaults for freq range, sweep duration, sample rate, and channel routing
- 40 new tests covering all new code paths, data flow branches, and CLI commands at 100% coverage
- `fake_pytta_module` session fixture in conftest — same lazy-import mock pattern as sounddevice

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `calibrate check` pre-flight hardware verification command
- `PreflightChecker` with async checks for UMIK microphone, miniDSP 2x4 HD (via minidspd), and Denon AVR
- `Config` class with YAML loading, deep-merge defaults, and template creation
- Color CLI output: green ✓ / red ✗ with actionable error hints
- 22 unit tests with 100% coverage of all happy paths and error branches
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (Python 3.12, uv, pytest)
- CLAUDE.md with architecture overview, safety limits, and development setup
- TESTING.md documenting mock strategy for PortAudio, httpx, and denonavr
